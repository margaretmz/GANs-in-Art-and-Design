# GANs in Art and Design
This repo contains the Colab notebooks for the GAN series on [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) which is many people's go-to place for learning about computer vision, deep learning and OpenCV. These posts are also part of the [PyImageSearch University](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-university/) courses where you can access both the tutorials and videos. The GAN implementations are written in **TensorFLow 2** and **Keras**.

## 1. Intro to GANs
Read my [Intro to GANs tutorial](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/09/13/intro-to-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/) to learn how GANs work and a brief intro to the GAN variants and applications.

## 2. DCGAN Fashion-MNIST
Read [Get Started: DCGAN for Fashion-MNIST](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/11/11/get-started-dcgan-for-fashion-mnist/) to learn how to implement a DCGAN to generate gray-scale (`28x28x1`) Fashion-MNIST like images.

## 3. DCGAN Zalando Fashion

Read this [GAN Training Challenges: DCGAN for Color Images ](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/12/13/gan-training-challenges-dcgan-for-color-images/) to learn how to use DCGAN to generate color (`64x64x3`) fashion images.

## 4. WGAN and WGAN-GP Anime Faces
In [Anime Faces with WGAN and WGAN-GP](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2022/02/07/anime-faces-with-wgan-and-wgan-gp/), I discuss how to move from DCGAN to WGAN, and then to WGAN-GP, for generating anime faces.
