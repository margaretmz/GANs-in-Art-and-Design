# GANs in Art and Design
This repo contains the Colab notebooks for the GAN series on [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) which is many people's go to place for learning about computer vision, deep learning and OpenCV. These posts are also part of the [PyImageSearch University](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-university/) courses where you can access both the tutorials and videos. The GAN implementations are written in **TensorFLow 2** and **Keras**.
